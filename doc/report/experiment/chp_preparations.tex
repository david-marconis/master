\chapter{Planning}
This chapter describes the planning that went into finding a suitable group that fit the target audience of the game prototype and the questionnaire that were developed to evaluate the results of the experimentation.


\section{Preparations}
Since this project and one of the research goals is aimed towards children, the play testing should be preformed with children. The natural place to look for children are in schools, so a local school was contacted to try to set up a play testing session with the school children.

Bente Sand√∏ the leader of the after school programme for Buvik School was contacted by email to inquire about the possibility to preform the play testing with their pupils. The response was positive and the planning on how the play test would be executed was started.


\section{Questionnaire}
A questionnaire was developed in order to evaluate the results of the play testing. The questionnaire is based of the gameflow framework \cite{sweetser2005gameflow}, and the questionnaire created by Fu et al \cite{fu2009egameflow}. The questions are divided into groups corresponding to the gameflow categories: Concentration, a. The final version of the questionnaire can be seen in Table \ref{tab:questions}. The questions were tailored towards children by simplifying them and making them easier to understand. Gameflow is discussed in section \ref{sec:gameflow}.

Note: the questions were asked verbally to the children, in Norwegian, and their answers were logged by the interviewer. The original Norwegian questionnaire is included in Appendix X.
